# Giovanni Gibelli
Full Stack Web Developer who love to code in React and build complex web applications using the latest technologies.

Latest project was a Wine trading app that connects wineries in need to sell or buy bulk wine, choosing between more than 4000 Italian wines. Every wine has a different grape composition by Italian law, the user can choose the right vineyards after selecting the wine. The user can post an ad, and if there is already a wine listed that matches the parameters, the user can send a message to the seller/buyer. The ads, messages, negotiations and reviews can be filtered, sorted and there is pagination on the server to improve performance. The app sends a notification and a mail when a new wine is posted that matches the user's active ad, users can chat in real-time, leave reviews and manage active negotiations and posted ads.

Before I discovered how interesting and rewarding programming can be, I worked as a PLC programmer for 5 years mainly in the wine making field and traveled in more than 20 countries.

In my free time I enjoy to code, surf and travel.
